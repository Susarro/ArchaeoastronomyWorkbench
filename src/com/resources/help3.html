<p>Charts are one of the main tools to offer to the user the results of the astronomical algorithms in a graphical and friendly way. They also provide a way to export the calculated information to CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.</p>

<p>The color of chart background, frame, ticks and gridline can be changed by double clicking on chart background.</p>

<p>Graphical variables plotted in series are grouped in axes. In the botton of the chart there is a pane which shows the different series names grouped in rows so that each of them corresponds to an axis. The color of the area of this row will change to blue when the mouse hovers over whenever the mouse is out of any of its series labels. In this case, only the background label will change to blue.</p>

<p>Double click on an axis row (but outside any of the series labels) to change the lower and upper limits, and tick spacing of this axis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Double click on the series label to change the color, width and shape of its plot.</p>

<p>When context menu is opened the following options are accessible: Print to send the chart to a printer, Copy to copy the chart to the clipboard as bitmap and Export to export the series information to a CSV file.</p>
